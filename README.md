## 🚀 Project Overview

**CyberCrimeClassificationUsingNLP** is a smart, AI-powered system designed to classify cybercrime reports using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Ontology Mapping (OWL)**. It provides automated classification support to help law enforcement and researchers streamline and categorize criminal case reports efficiently.

> 🎯 Built with Python, OWL Ontology, and NLP libraries for maximum impact.

## 📚 Description

🔐 This tool classifies written crime case descriptions by identifying keywords and mapping them to a structured **CyberCrime Ontology**.

It offers **two main functionalities**:

1. **Display All Cybercrime Categories**  
   View a list of cybercrime types and their key characteristics extracted using NLP techniques from real-world documentation.

2. **Classify Your Own Case Descriptions**  
   Input your custom `.txt` crime reports, and the program classifies them into crime types by converting them into OWL individuals with inferred properties.

## 🧪 How to Use

* Press `1` to view a list of classified cybercrime types and descriptions.
* Press `2` to import and classify your own crime case files.

  * Place your `.txt` files inside the folder: `./descriptions/cases`
  * After classification, open `CyberCrimeOntology.owl` in Protégé
  * Start the **HermiT Reasoner** and view inferred classifications under "Individuals by Class"
